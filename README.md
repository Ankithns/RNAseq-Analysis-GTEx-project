# RNAseq-Analysis-GTEx-project
RNAseq analysis using Differential packages - DeSeq2 and Limma.

GTEx project ia a puiblic repository that aims to study tissue-specific gene expression and expression. Samples are collected from Non-diseased individuals across 54 tissue sites. 

Kidney and Liver were selected as example tissues to understand the differences between DEseq2 and Limma packages. Further, Differential Expression was performed.
